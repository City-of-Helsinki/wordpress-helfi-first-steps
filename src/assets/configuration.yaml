        EU citizens have the same rights as Finnish citizens to work, study
        and start a business in Finland. Therefore, they do not need a
        residence permit.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an EU citizen, you can stay and work freely in Finland for up to
        three months with only a valid identity card or passport.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will need a tax card from the Tax Administration (<a
        href="https://www.vero.fi/">Vero.fi</a>), if you plan on working.

        EU citizens have the same rights as Finnish citizens to work, study
        and start a business in Finland. Therefore, they do not need a
        residence permit. If you plan to stay in Finland for more than three
        months, however, you must register your right of residence with the
        Finnish Immigration Service (<a
        href="https://migri.fi/etusivu">Migri.fi</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        The application must be submitted within three months of the day of
        your arrival, at the latest. To complete the registration, you must
        book an appointment and visit a Finnish Immigration Service service
        point. The immigration authorities will ask you at this time to prove
        that you can earn your own livelihood.
      </p>

      <p>
        After this, you need to register your municipality of residence with
        the population register (Dvv.fi). Once you have registered in person
        with these two authorities, you will receive a personal identity code.
        This means you will be considered a Helsinki resident and be entitled
        to municipal services.
      </p>

        You will need a tax card from the Tax Administration (Vero.fi), if you
        plan on working. To receive a tax card, you must bring your employment
        contract, proof of completed EU registration, and a valid passport or
        photo ID to the tax office.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to get a tax card, you will also need a Finnish personal
        identity code or a temporary identity code. If you have not yet
        received one from the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri.fi ) or the
        population register (Dvv.fi), you can apply for one at the tax office.

        EU citizens may stay in Finland for up to 90 days as jobseekers without needing to register
        with employment services. After this, they must register as a jobseeker at their local TE
        office (Te-palvelut.fi).
      </p>

      <p>
        You will need a tax card from the Tax Administration (Vero.fi) and a Finnish personal
        identity code, if you plan on working in Finland.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the Finnish Immigration Service registers your right of residence, you will automatically be
        assigned a Finnish personal identity code, but you can also get one at the population register
        (Dvv.fi) or the Tax Administration (Vero.fi). You will be asked to present your employment
        contract, proof of completed EU registration, and a valid passport or photographic ID card to
        the tax office.

        If you have come to Helsinki to study as an EU citizen, you must show
        proof of admission to a Finnish learning institution when registering
        your right of residence with the Finnish Immigration Service
        (Migri.fi).
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that if your only reason for moving to Finland is to
        study, you will likely not be eligible for state-supported social
        benefits, as you will be considered a temporary resident. See the
        state benefits agency Kela.fi for more information.

        If you are planning to work or start a business while you study, you will need to apply for a
        tax card from the Tax Administration (Vero.fi). If you work in construction, you also need a
        tax number.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not have a personal identity number in Finland, the Tax Administration can supply
        you with a temporary identity code for tax card purposes. You will need to present a signed
        employment contract, proof of registration, and a valid passport or photo ID card for this.

        Family members of citizens of EU countries have the right to move to
        Finland to be with their family. If your family members are also
        citizens of EU countries, they must register their right of residence
        with the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri.fi). The registration
        application must be submitted within three months of the day of
        arrival at the latest.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your family members are citizens of non-EU countries, they must
        apply for a <a
        href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-card-for-family-members">Residence
        card for a family member of an EU citizen</a>. Please note that as a
        rule, Finnish law defines family as the nuclear family, so unless you
        can prove that for example your parents or siblings are solely
        dependent on your care, they will likely not be granted a residence
        permit based on this kind of family tie.
      </p>

      <p>
        Family members who are granted a right of residence by the immigration
        authorities must then register their municipality of residence with
        the population register (Dvv.fi ). After this, they will receive a
        personal identity code. This means they will be considered Helsinki
        residents and be entitled to municipal services.

        If you are under 18 years old, you must have written consent from your
        guardian(s) to move to Finland. A notary public or other comparable
        authority must confirm this written consent document.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must submit this proof of consent to the Finnish Immigration
        Service (Migri.fi) when you register your right of residence. The
        registration application must be submitted within three months of the
        day of arrival at the latest.

        Citizens of non-EU countries who visit Finland for fewer than 90 days
        (as a tourist, visiting family, or on business) need a visa, unless
        they are citizens of a visa-exempt country. Check the foreign ministry
        website (Um.fi) for more information on different visa requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you plan to work in Finland, you may need a residence permit even if your stay will be
        shorter than 90 days. Citizens of non-EU countries who plan to stay for more than 90 days
        must apply for a residence permit. See the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri.fi) for more
        information.

        Citizens of non-EU countries who plan to come to Finland for more than 90 days must first
        apply for a residence permit from the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri.fi). It is not
        possible to apply for a residence permit on another personâ€™s behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of residence permit you need to apply for depends on your reason for coming to
        Finland. Residence permit applications are different if you plan to 1) work in Finland, 2) be
        with a family member in Finland, 3) study in Finland, 4) remigrate to Finland, or 5) come to
        Finland on other grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can apply for a residence permit online at EnterFinland.fi, but within three months of
        submitting the application, you will need to visit a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate) in
        person to confirm your identity and present original copies of your application appendices.
        Check if your documents must be translated or legalised before your scheduled visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applicants must wait for their residence permit decisions in the same country they submitted
        the application.

        Citizens of non-EU countries who plan to come to Finland to work must first secure a job
        here and apply for a residence permit for employed persons before they enter the country.
        The employer in question must also complete a form and append it to the residence permit
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already have a residence permit for Finland based on some other grounds, such as
        family ties, you may already have the right to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few special permits are granted for specialists, researchers and seasonal work. Consult the
        Finnish Immigration Service (Migri.fi) for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your stay in Finland will exceed three months, you must also register your municipality of
        residence at the population register (Dvv.fi) after your arrival. This is true even if you have
        already been issued a personal identity code along with your residence permit.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need a tax card from the Tax Administration (Vero.fi), if you plan on working. If
        you work in construction, you also need a tax number.

        Citizens of non-EU countries who plan on coming to Finland to study must already have been
        granted a study place before they can apply for a residence permit based on studies.

        Please note that if your only reason for moving to Finland is to study, you will likely not be
        eligible for state-supported social benefits, as you will be considered a temporary resident.

        You must also register your municipality of residence at the population register (Dvv.fi) upon

        If a non-EU citizen family member wishes to move to Finland to join you, they must apply
        for a residence permit from the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri.fi). Applicants must wait
        for their residence permit decisions in the same country they submitted the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, you must also have proof of sufficient funds to support both yourself and your
        family members in Finland. The required income varies by family size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that as a rule, Finnish law defines family as the nuclear family, so unless you can
        prove that for example your parents or siblings are solely dependent on your care, they will

        these two authorities, they will receive personal identity codes. This means they will be
        considered Helsinki residents and be entitled to municipal services. They will also be eligible
        to work and study in the same way as other residents of the city.
